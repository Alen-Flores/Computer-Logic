    ## Computers use binary to represent data

    Their usage traces back to 1679 by *Gottfried Leibniz*, which introduced the binary-decimal conversion and
    binary arithmetic.

    ## Computers use binary to represent data

    Later developements were made by *George Boole* in 1854. Forming an algebraic system of logic: "Boolean
    Algebra".

    ## Binary is Simple

    Binary was preferred over other number systems due to the simplicity of the format.

    ## Binary is Simple

    Components need only 2 states to manage, a higher number of components may introduce complexity and
    ambiguity.

    - High or low voltage
    - Magnetic Polarity
    - Present or not Present

    ## Binary is Simple

    Within binary logic, there exists:
    - Only 1 possible unary operation ($\lnot$).
    - Only 4 possible states between 2 numbers.
    - Only 16 possible binary operations.

    8 Common ones:

    `AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, CONST 1, CONST 0`

    <small> (The remaining 8 are rarely used and are not named). </small>

    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    \lnot A &amp;= \text{NAND}(A,A) \\
    A \land B &amp;= \text{NAND}(NAND(A,B),NAND(A,B)) \\
    A \lor B &amp;= \text{NAND}(\lnot A, \lnot B) \\
    A \oplus B &amp;= (A \lor B) \land \text{NAND}(A,A) \\
    \end{aligned}
    \]

    ## Binary is Simple

    This allows for a smaller set of components, significantly simplifying assembly.

    It is viable to just use NAND gates and the constructions of it in architecture.
